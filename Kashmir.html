          which has had multiple names over the centuries, is connected to the
          Persian and Muslim faith as well. Names associated with the hill
          include Gopadari Hill, Sandhimana-parvata , Koh-e-Suleman,
          Takht-i-Sulaiman. The hill about 5 kms from Srinagar has a height of
